### **Why this looks more professional:**
1.  **Badges:** The little blue and green "Version" and "License" tags at the top give it an official "software" feel.
2.  **Table Format:** Using a table for the "Tech Stack" is much easier for recruiters to scan quickly.
3.  **Visual Hierarchy:** It uses bolding and icons to separate "Features" from "Instructions."
4.  **No Fluff:** It focuses on the value the app provides (Privacy, Portability, Analytics).

### **To Update it on GitHub:**
After saving the file, run these commands:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "style: upgrade readme to professional format"
